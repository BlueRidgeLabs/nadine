Staff Application
-------------

Nadine's Staff Application is really where this whole project got started. The original iteration was just referred to as the 'daily log' and was used by staff to track who had come into the space during the day and then was used to help with billing. Nadine's current Staff Application makes tracking subscriptions, usage, and billing easily.

Tracking Usage
//////////////

Staff have the ability to see, real-time, who is signed into the space. Based on a user's subscriptions, Nadine will set a visit as billable or waived but staff can override that easily. Nadine will send emails to staff to remind them of any tasks to be completed for checked-in members. With that information, staff can go into Nadine and mark tasks as completed or assign a task to another person. This action will lead to that task to appear on the top of the assigned person's to-do lists until completed.

Tracking Billing
////////////////

Proper billing allows the space to function well and Nadine is designed to automatically handle bill generation but allow for staff access to editing said bills. Members regularly have questions about billing and Nadine is designed to allow staff the ability to 

When a person becomes a member of the space, staff can use Nadine to transfer billing information for use with an online payment platform. If at any time a member needs to update that information, staff can do so on Nadine easily.

Staff can also open bills, edit line items, add custom charges (bought a t-shirt?), and email receipts.
